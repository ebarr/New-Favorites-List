        <p class="author">Chance</p>
        <p class="description">Quitting my job and moving to Chicago was a big deal. It was in with the new and out with the old. I've learned new skills, met cool people, and the drive from NC was pretty memorable.</p>

        <p class="description">I took a trip to Killington, Vermont in March to go snowboarding. My expectations were having skied out west, but it was a great time. We got 18" of snow one day.</p>

        <p class="description">I was just sitting in this bar/restaurant when a storm trooper walked in the front door. He walked around, conversed with some patrons, and then calmly left. Not before several photo opportunities, though.</p>

        <p class="description">I went on a few trips with my family in 2013, which was a lot of fun but can always be stressful. The best trip was to Cape Cod with all of my cousins from across the country.</p>

        <p class="author">Erinn</p>
        <p class="description">Some of my friends kept telling me to watch American Horror so I started in 2013 and love it so far. The series has this way to surprise people in a really strange and twisted way.</p>

        <p class="description">I bought an upright bass in 2013. It was an investment that I immediately deemed worthwhile. Its been a fun thing to explore in my free time, but not a fun thing to carry around.</p>

        <p class="description">I don't know why I enjoy this tweet so much. It caught me off guard, I guess. It gave me this mental image of Chuck sitting by a fire drinking wine, and I thought, "We could get along just fine".</p>
